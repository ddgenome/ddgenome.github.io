<p>GenomeWeb's <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing">In Sequence</a> magazine recently posted a story about <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>'s efforts, led by <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/people/mardis_elaine">Elaine Mardis</a>, to determine <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/washu-sequencing-breast-cancer-tumors-determine-genomic-profile-aromatase-inhibi">genetic patterns associated with aromatase inhibitor, a common therapy that blocks estrogen production, response in breast cancer</a>. The hope is that we can find certain patterns of mutations that associate with therapy response (or non-response). Then, genetic tests can be developed that probe these mutations and they can be used to predict whether patients will respond to the therapy. Those that are predicted to respond will receive aromatase inhibitor therapy; those that are predicted to not respond will receive some other course of treatment. In other words, the goal is to further refine personalized medicine in breast cancer treatment. As the article states, we are going to sequence the whole genomes of 50 patients' tumor and normal genomes (we already have completed the sequencing of over 40 patients), 25 responders and 25 non-responders.</p>
