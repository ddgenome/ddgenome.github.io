<p>It somehow escaped my attention last November when it was announced and earlier this year in February when the ceremony was held that <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/Bio/WilsonBIO.cgi">Richard K. Wilson</a> and <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/Bio/WeinstockBIO.cgi">George M. Weinstock</a>, Director and Associate Director, respectively, of <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>, were <a href="http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/fellows/new_fellows.shtml">elected as Fellows</a> of the <a href="http://www.aaas.org/">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>. Congratulations to both!</p>
