<p>Welcome to a blog about the confluence (and sometimes incongruence) of several of the most important topics surrounding the future of human health: genomics, information technology, and politics.  In other words, PolITiGenomics.  Future posts will cover each of these topics and sometimes the overlap between them.  With the 2008 primary, caucus, and election season in full swing and the advent of next generation sequencing, there should be a lot to talk about.</p>
