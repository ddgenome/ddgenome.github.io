<p>â€¦and a little bit rock'n'roll.  On Thursday, the paper describing the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7192/abs/nature06936.html">platypus genome</a> will be published in Nature.  From an evolutionary standpoint, the platypus is quite an interesting species.  It is a mammal, but it has traits of birds (lays eggs, has a bill) and reptiles (lays eggs, produces venom).  Oh, and did I mention you can literally scare a platypus to death?  You can learn more from NPR's coverage, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90228565">Platypus Is Even More Strange Than It Looks</a>, including quotes from Rick Wilson, head of The Genome Center at Washington University.</p>
