<p> <a href="http://www.mikero.com/blog/2009/02/20/more-darwin"><img class="alignright" alt="Darwin Change" src="assets/darwin-1-sm.gif" title="Darwin Change" width="201" height="300" /></a> A colleague pointed out the clever image to the right created by <a href="http://www.mikero.com/">Mike Rosulek</a>. Mike has set up a <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/darwin2009">storefront on Zazzle</a> to sell items with the image and a few different slogans, giving the proceeds to the <a href="http://ncseweb.org/">National Center for Science Education</a>. Sadly, the top "Latest News" item on the NCSE's website is a story about <a href="http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/02/antievolution-legislation-missouri-004615">anti-evolution legislation recently introduced in the Missouri House of Representatives</a>. Previous attempts to pass such a bill have failed. Here's hope that, in this case at least, past performance is the best predictor of future outcomes. One last time for the slow learners: intelligent design is not a scientific theory. If you want to teach it, teach it in a social studies class.</p>
