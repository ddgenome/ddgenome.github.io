<p>Last week was the first Genome Informatics Alliance meeting. It was a meeting of second-generation sequence vendors, users, data repositories, and other high-throughput endeavors, e.g., high-energy physics and Google, to discuss the challenges that second-generation sequencing is creating for bioinformatics. I gave a talk at the meeting to help introduce the people not in genomics to the issues we currently face. Yesterday I recreated the talk, recording an audio track (while battling a bit of a cold), then uploaded the talk and audio today. After wrestling a bit with <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a>'s screen casting interface, I ended up with the video below.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the video. You may need to turn up the volume on your computer to hear it. I'll post more about the meeting soon.</p>
