<p>Researchers in Japan have created the <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080707091915.htm">first DNA molecule made from entirely artificially created bases</a>. While some are trying to manufacture artificial life by creating DNA molecules in the lab, the aim of this research is to take advantage of, and in this case expand on, DNA's high information density to create a very dense data storage platform. Natural DNA has four different bases (A, G, C, and T) it can use to encode information. To expand DNA's ability to encode information, these researchers created four new bases and integrated them in to a DNA molecule.</p>
