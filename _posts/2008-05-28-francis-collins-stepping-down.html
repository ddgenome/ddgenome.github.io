<p><a href="http://www.genome.gov/27026551">Francis Collins is stepping down</a> as director of the <a href="http://www.genome.gov/">National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)</a> effective August 1, 2008.  He's had a heck of a run, from overseeing the <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10001772">Human Genome Project</a> on to the direct application of sequencing technology to human health issues in projects like the Tumor Sequencing Project and <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a>.  It is fitting that only days before he announced he is stepping down, the legislation he has worked tirelessly on for over a decade, the <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/2008/02/genomic-privacy.html">Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)</a>, became <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/2008/05/gina-becomes-law.html">law</a>.</p>
