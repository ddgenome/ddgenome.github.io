<p>The Genome Center's <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/people/mardis_elaine">Elaine Mardis</a> and <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/people/wilson_richard">Rick Wilson</a> have just published a review article on <a href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/18/R2/R163">cancer genome sequencing</a>. The article focuses on the application of next-generation sequencing technologies to the study of cancer, covering structural variation studies using low coverage paired-end sequence data, targeted gene sequencing studies using PCR and Sanger sequencing, transcriptome sequencing using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq">RNA-seq</a>, and whole-genome sequencing, e.g., our <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/?s=AML">AML publications</a>. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the future of cancer sequencing and the functional genomics required to determine the role identified mutations play in cancer progression.</p>
