<p>A colleague of mine in our human analysis group, Dan Koboldt, has started a blog called <a href="http://www.massgenomics.org/">Mass Genomics</a>.  His <a href="http://www.massgenomics.org/2008/03/annotation-insertionsdeletions.html">first blog post</a> is about his efforts to develop methodologies to detect and annotate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indel">indels</a> from cDNA sequence generated on the <a href="http://www.454.com/">454 FLX platform</a>.</p>
