<p>In my recent post on <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/2008/04/mlk.html">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, I wrote about how our memory of the man was being oversimplified.  Taylor Branch gave a <a href="http://video1.cathedral.org/wmv/tb080331.wmv">speech</a> and wrote an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/opinion/06branch.html?em&amp;ex=1207800000&amp;en=77859917b348ebe8&amp;ei=5087%0A">opinion piece in the New York Times</a> discussing the same topic, albeit much more completely and eloquently.</p>
<p>Also, for those who saw my original posting and not the updates, be sure to check out Bill Moyers' pieces on the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/03282008/watch.html">Kerner Commission Report</a> and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/03282008/watch2.html">Newark Mayor Cory Booker</a>.</p>
