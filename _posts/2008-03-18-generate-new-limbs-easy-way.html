<p>Researchers at Duke recently discovered how <a href="http://www.dukehealth.org/HealthLibrary/News/10257">microRNAs play a role in the ability of the zebrafish to regenerate its fins</a>.  While a long way off, scientists hope the research will lead to new insights into how to prompt human tissues, such as the heart after a heart attack, to fix itself.  <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a> has played a role in <a href="http://zfish.wustl.edu/">zebrafish genomic research</a> by sequencing <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/est.html">EST</a> libraries.</p>
