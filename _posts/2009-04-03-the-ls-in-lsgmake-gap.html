<p>I have released a new version of <a href="ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/software/lsgmake-gap/">lsgmake-gap</a>, <a href="ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/software/lsgmake-gap/lsgmake-gap-0.13.tar.gz">0.13</a> (<a href="ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/software/lsgmake-gap/lsgmake-gap-0.13.tar.gz.md5.txt">md5</a>). This version puts the "ls" back in lsgmake-gap by adding the <code>--bsub-options</code> command-line option which allows the user to specify arbitrary options to bsub. So now you should be able to easily take advantage of all the power of <a href="http://www.platform.com/Products/platform-lsf">LSF</a>. Also, if you have had problems with job-name dependency trouble because of lsgmake-gap's reuse of job names when resubmitting a failed analysis, there is now the <code>--id</code> command-line option to provide a unique identifier for each execution.</p>
