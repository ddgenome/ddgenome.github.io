I started writing this a few days ago, but now that [Joe Biden said
his "single greatest concern" is that the current President will try
to steal the election][wapo], it's a bit less prescient.  In previous
weeks, the current President has repeatedly called into question the
validity of mail-in voting, despite overwhelming evidence to the
contrary.  Many have tied this allegation to the efforts by the
Republican party to suppress voting over the last 15-20 years.  But it
is important to realize, this is not about suppressing the vote, the
Republicans have already deployed much more effective measures for
that.  It is about laying the groundwork for calling the results of
the upcoming election into question should those results not be what
the current President wants.
