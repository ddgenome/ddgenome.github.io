<p>ScienceNews has a piece on the <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/pictures/bryantaft/bryan_taft.html">first presidential campaign where sound recordings</a> of the candidates were available for people to purchase and listen to in their homes. The recordings were on wax cylinders. You can listen to the recordings at the link above.</p>
