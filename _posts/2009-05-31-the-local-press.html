<p>Some media outlets take a little longer to recognize a story, even one in their own back yard. St. Louis Magazine, a local culture and dining monthly, has an article in the June 2009 issue about our whole-genome sequencing approach to studying AML entitled <a href="http://www.stlmag.com/media/St-Louis-Magazine/June-2009/Healthy-Living-The-Code-Breakers/">The Code Breakers</a>. You can tell from the tenor of the interview, they're not exactly targeting a scientific audience (given their target audience this is neither surprising nor a bad thing).</p>
