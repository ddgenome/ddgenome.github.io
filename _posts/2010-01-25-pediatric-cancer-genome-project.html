<p>Today, <a href="https://www.stjude.org/">St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital</a> and <a href="http://medschool.wustl.edu/">Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis</a> announced a joint <a href="http://www.pediatriccancergenomeproject.org/site/">Pediatric Cancer Genome Project</a>. This project aims to sequence tumor and normal genomes from over 600 pediatric cancer patients over three years. There is a press conference today (right now) at the <a href="http://npc.press.org/">National Press Club</a> in Washington, DC (click on the 10 a.m. item in the DayBook on the left-hand side of the page). St. Jude's will be supplying the tissue samples and <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a> will be doing all of the whole-genome sequencing on the samples. Genomic analysis will be done jointly between WU and St. Jude's. It's an ambitious project and personally I am very excited to be a part of it. You can find more coverage of the project in the press at the <a href="http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/20133.aspx">WU NewsRoom</a>, <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/washu-st-jude-team-launches-pediatric-cancer-sequencing-project">GenomeWeb</a>, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100125-712122.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9DEUKHG3.htm">BusinessWeek</a>, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-01-26-genome26_st_N.htm">USA Today</a>, Memphis' <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/jan/25/st-jude-partnership-will-clear-way-cancer-treatmen/">The Commercial Appeal</a>, <a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kwmu/news.newsmain/article/1/0/1603847/St..Louis.Public.Radio.News/New.$65.million.childhood.cancer.project.underway">KWMU</a> (local NPR station), <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/01/25/child-cancer-genome.html">CBC</a>, and the <a href="http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2010/01/25/daily2.html">St. Louis Business Journal</a>.
