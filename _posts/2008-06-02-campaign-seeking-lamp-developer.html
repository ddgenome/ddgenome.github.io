According to the job posting, you can "Write Software, Change Washington". Sen. Obama's campaign has been <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/19106326">cited</a> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/04/obama.fundraising/index.html">many</a> <a href="http://www.coxwashington.com/hp/content/reporters/stories/2007/04/09/POLITICS_NET09_1stLD_COX.html">times</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7412045.stm">for</a> <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/idblog/2007/11/18/civic-engagement-and-the-internet-online-volunteers/">its</a> <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/02/07/obama_fundraising_strength_com.html">use</a> of the internet in organizing and fundraising.  Who knows, if you do a good enough job maybe a cabinet position could be in your future. Of course, if you have those skills and would rather save the world than change Washington, you can come <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/info/jobs.cgi">work for us</a>.</p>
