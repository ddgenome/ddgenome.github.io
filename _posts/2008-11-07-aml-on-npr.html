<p>Dr. Tim Ley of <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu">The Genome Center</a> is going to be a <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/200811072">guest on NPR's Talks of the Nation Science Friday</a> today.  He will be talking about the <a href="/2008/11/first-whole-cancer-genome-sequenced.html">AML paper published in Nature</a> yesterday. The show starts at 2 p.m. EST but will be interrupted on our local NPR station, <a href="http://www.kwmu.org/">KWMU 90.7 FM</a>, for President-elect Obama's press conference at 2:20 p.m. EST. So if you want to listen, it might be better to listen <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/about/listen/">on-line</a> (although other stations may be interrupted as well) or get the <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/feeds/about/">podcast</a>.</p>
