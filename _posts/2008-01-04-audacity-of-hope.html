<p>Yes, I <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Audacity-Hope-Thoughts-Reclaiming-American/dp/0307237699">stole the title</a>, but not for the reasons you might think.  The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#IA">Iowa caucuses</a> were yesterday and the majority of Democrats <span style="font-weight:bold;">and</span> Republicans voted for <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/01/let_the_word_go_forth.html">change</a>.  The <span style="font-style: italic;">change</span> candidates, <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">Barak Obama</a>, <a href="http://johnedwards.com/">John Edwards</a>, <a href="http://www.mikehuckabee.com/">Mike Huckabee</a>, <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/">John McCain</a>, and <a href="http://www.ronpaul2008.com/">Ron Paul</a> all did better than expected.  The <span style="font-style: italic;">experience</span> candidates were handed a resounding defeat.  But can it be sustained?  When will the moneyed interests step up an make their choices known?  When will the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/">character assassinations</a> begin?</p>
