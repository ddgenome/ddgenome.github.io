<p>It turns out that Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin were born on the same day. No, they didn't just share a birthday, they were actually born on the exact same day: February 12, 1809. In fact, there were even more parallels between their lives, e.g., both lost their mothers early in childhood and both suffered from depression. These and other similarities and differences are explored in recent books (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rebel-Giants-Revolutionary-Abraham-Lincoln/dp/1591026105/">Rebel Giants by historian David R. Contosta</a>) and a Newsweek article out this week entitled <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/143742?tid=relatedcl">"Who Was More Important: Lincoln or Darwin?"</a> The Newsweek article focuses on how each of these men transformed the world into which they were born into the world in which we live today. It's a fascinating read about true icons in politics, science, and history (although it is a bit odd that Newsweek feels the need to declare one more important than the other).</p>
