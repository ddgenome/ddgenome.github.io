<p>Ars Technica has the first in a (promised to be) series on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/guides/2009/09/a-brief-guide-to-dna-sequencing.ars">DNA sequencing</a>. This article just gets you through Sanger sequencing on a capillary electrophoresis instrument. Next-generation sequencing will be in the next one. Thanks to <a href="http://www.granneman.com/">Scott Granneman</a> for pointing out the article.</p>
