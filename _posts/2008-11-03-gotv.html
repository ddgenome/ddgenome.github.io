<p>Well, it is all more or less over, except for the voting. You can find out where you are supposed to vote using the <a href="http://maps.google.com/vote">2008 US Voter Info</a> Google Maps application. You can find information on voting, polling places, ballot initiatives, and sample ballots on your state's Secretary of State web site. If you live in Missouri, you can enter your personal information on the <a href="https://mcvr.mo.gov/voterlookup/">Vote Missouri</a> web site to find your polling place and look at a sample ballot. So get out and vote (if you haven't <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/03/early.voting/?iref=mpstoryview">already</a>).</p>
<p>If you have any problems when you vote or have any questions about voting, contact <a href="http://www.866ourvote.org/">1-866-OUR-VOTE (1-866-687-8683)</a>.</p>
