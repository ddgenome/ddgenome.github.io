<p>A colleague of mine at <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a> pointed me to this <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/06/oscon-2009-highlights-and-earl.html">O'Reilly Radar blog post about the talks at OSCON 2009 that Allison Randal, one of the organizers, considers highlights</a>. Very kindly, she mentions my talk, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/7985">The Freedom to Cure Cancer</a>. I have a rough outline of the talk clanging around in my head. Having it take shape on a slide deck is going to take some work (and a lot of time on Google image search). Hopefully, the talk will live up to the hype.</p>
