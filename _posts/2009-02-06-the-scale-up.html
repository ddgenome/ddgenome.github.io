<p>It was <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20090206005115&newsLang=en">announced this morning</a> that we will be getting 21 more Illumina GA2 instruments, bringing our total to 35 at <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>. No doubt it will be a great challenge and a great opportunity. Here is a graph I presented in my talk last night showing the acceleration in informatics staff, CPU, storage, and sequence generation (the absolute values of each line have been scaled to the same range since all the data have different units; only the rate of change of the slope, i.e., second derivative, of each line is meaningful).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how the CPU line tracks fairly well with Moore's Law. Put this together with <a href="http://www.massgenomics.org/2009/02/agbt-day-1-illumina-shines.html">Illumina's data increase plans for the coming year</a> and it looks like I will have to adjust the already frightening acceleration of sequence data generation rate.</p>
