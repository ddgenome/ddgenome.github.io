<p>The folks in our Medical Genomics group have compiled a list of <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/tools/cancer-genomics">bioinformatics tools that are useful in the field of cancer genomics</a>. The tools, mostly focused on next/second-generation sequence data, are organized by their purposes (sequence alignment, variant detection, annotation/pathway, significance analysis, group significance analysis, gene expression clustering, clinical correlation, cross-tumor analysis, and graphical/visualization). A lot of the tools were developed at <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>, but they have also included tools from many different investigators that we find useful. Many, but unfortunately not all, of the tools are free/open source software.</p>
