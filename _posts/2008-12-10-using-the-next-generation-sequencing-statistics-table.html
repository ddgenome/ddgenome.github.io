<p>Since posting the <a href="/next-generation-sequencing-informatics">next-generation sequencing informatics statistics table</a> I have received several requests asking if they could reproduce the table in one format or another. The answer is yes, as long as you adhere to the license it is published under: the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License</a>. Basically, if you allow other people to do to the table you present what you are asking me to do for you (reproduce the table with proper credit and, possibly, alteration), you are free to republish the content. If you have any questions, feel free to post a comment and ask. Enjoy.</p>
