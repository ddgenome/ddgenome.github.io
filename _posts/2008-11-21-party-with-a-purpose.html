The evening was a big success: it sold out, everyone had a great time, and, most importantly, we raised a lot of money for the Nursery. Thanks to everyone who came, including Olympic Gold Medal winner <a href="http://www.lorichalupny.com/">Lori Chalupny</a> and St. Louis County Executive <a href="http://www.charliedooley.com/">Charlie Dooley</a>, and special thanks to our sponsors Stephen and Gail Lambright (Platinum Sponsor), <a href="http://www.cafenapoli.com/">Cafe Napoli</a> (the space and wait staff), <a href="http://www.claytonvalet.com/">Clayton Valet</a> (valet), and <a href="http://steadyrising.com/">Steady Rising Entertainment</a> (DJ).
