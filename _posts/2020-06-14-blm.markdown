We've been fighting systemic racism for decades and while on the one
hand much has improved since the mid-20th century, it also feels like
not much has changed since Michael Brown was murdered in Ferguson six
years ago.  Social media posts and protests are good, but what can we
do to sustain our current volition into systemic change?  Here are
some resources I have found useful when trying to answer that
question.
