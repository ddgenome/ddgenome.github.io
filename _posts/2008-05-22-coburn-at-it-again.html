<p>Sen. Tom Coburn is at it <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/2008/02/genomic-privacy.html">again</a>.  This time <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/13/AR2008051302305.html?wpisrc=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=newsletter">he has joined forces with six other Republican Senators</a> to stop President Bush's proposed increase in funding for <a href="http://www.pepfar.gov/">PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief)</a>.  The bill has overwhelming bipartisan support and will save many lives, yet the Democratic leadership of the Senate seems unwilling to push the issue.  Is this how "leaders" should behave?</p>
