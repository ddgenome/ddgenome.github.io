<p> <a href="http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm"><img class="alignright" alt="Against Intellectual Monopoly" src="assets/9780521879286.jpg" title="Against Intellectual Monopoly" width="180" height="270" /></a> Two <a href="http://www.wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a> professors, <a href="http://www.micheleboldrin.com/">Michele Boldrin</a> and <a href="http://www.dklevine.com/">David Levine</a>, have a new book about the current state of intellectual property entitled <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521879286">Against Intellectual Monopoly</a>. You can purchase the book on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Against-Intellectual-Monopoly-Michele-Boldrin/dp/0521879280/">Amazon</a> and it is freely available <a href="http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm">online in PDF format</a> (<a href="http://www.micheleboldrin.com/research/aim.html">also here</a>). There is a very positive review of the book (with more in depth analysis promised) available at the <a href="http://mises.org/story/3298">Ludwig von Mises Institute website</a>. The authors are not socialists wanting to end property rights; these are strong free markets advocates who see current monopolistic protections for non-scarce resources as damaging to the free market competition of ideas. Jeffrey A. Tucker, the author of the review for the Mises Institute, even posits that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> is more akin to a free market solution than what currently exists as a result of government-instituted patent and copyright protections. Something to add to the reading list.</p>
