<p>There was an article in US News and World Report calling for a new <a href="http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/cancer/2008/06/12/we-need-a-new-war-on-cancer.html">war on cancer</a>. A couple of the more far out <a href="http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/cancer/2008/06/12/we-need-a-new-war-on-cancer/comments/">comments on the article</a> confirms my impression of your standard US News and World Report reader (you can recognize them on the street because they are wearing tin-foil hats). More recently, Science had a news item on the recent <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/321/5885/26a">meeting of NCI's Board of Scientific Advisors</a> that included a report on <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a> project. The report  presented our progress in understanding glioblastoma, including some novel glioblastoma mutations discovered in our sequencing here at <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>. It seems "big science" is once again teaching its critics a thing or two.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Check out my colleague's post on this subject: <a href="http://www.massgenomics.org/2008/07/tcga-the-billion-dollar-cancer-project.html">TCGA: The billion-dollar cancer project</a>.</p>
