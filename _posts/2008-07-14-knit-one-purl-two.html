<p>Want to give just the right present to your favorite genomicist, how about knitting a sweater made out of DNA? Japanese researchers have developed a technique that can <a href="http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2008/DNASewingMachines.asp">manipulate DNA like thread</a> (or yarn) without breaking it. Using optical tweezers (lasers) to place DNA extended by electroosmotic flow in microfabricated hooks, they were able to wind the DNA around miniature bobbins. After the DNA is localized on the bobbins, it can be probed for different genetic markers providing not only the existence of the desired DNA tag, but also the location. The full journal article was published in Lab Chip, <a href="http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayHTMLArticleforfree.cfm?JournalCode=LC&Year=2008&ManuscriptID=b803753a&Iss=Advance_Article">On-site manipulation of single chromosomal DNA molecules by using optically driven microstructures</a>.</p>
