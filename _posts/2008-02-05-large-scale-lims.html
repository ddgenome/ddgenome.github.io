<p>We recently <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/362">published a paper</a> in <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/">BMC Bioinformatics</a> describing the laboratory information management system (LIMS) we have implemented at <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a> at <a href="http://www.wustl.edu/">Washington University</a>.  The title of the paper is <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2194795">Design and implementation of a generalized laboratory data model</a>.  BMC Bioinformatics is an open-access journal, so the paper is release under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">license</a>.  A lot of the challenges we faced (and still face) in developing the LIMS are widely applicable in software engineering.  For example, making a system that was both very flexible and very scalable is quite challenging.  The flexibility is needed because, as a research facility, our pipelines are constantly changing.  Scalability is important because, as a genome sequencing center, we have very high data throughput (tens of millions of transactions per month).</p>
