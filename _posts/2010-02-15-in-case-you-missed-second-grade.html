<p><a href="/2010/02/seeing-double.html">Speaking of global climate change and snowstorms</a>, NPR has a story this morning about how a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123671588">lot of snow in Washington, DC does not contradict the theory of global climate change</a>. For those who missed second grade, the piece contains this information.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>A storm is part of what scientists classify as weather. Weather is largely influenced by local conditions and changes week to week. It's fickle â€” fraught with wild ups and downs.</p>
<p>Climate is the long-term trend of atmospheric conditions across large regions, even the whole planet. Changes in climate are slow and measured in decades, not weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judging from the comments on the story, it seems some are not swayed by facts and logic. I am sure their objections are based on sound scientific inquiry and not politically motivated.</p>
