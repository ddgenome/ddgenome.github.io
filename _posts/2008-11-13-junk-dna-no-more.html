<p>The New York Times has a good article, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/science/11gene.html?_r=3&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin">Now - The Rest of the Genome</a>, on the latest research on genes and the non-protein-encoding parts of the genome. As reported in our recent <a href="/2008/11/first-whole-cancer-genome-sequenced.html">AML paper</a>, while we found many somatic variants (i.e., variants specific to the cancer genome) throughout the genome, at present we are really only able to interpret those variants that fall in genes. Research such as that described in the New York Times article, e.g., <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">ENCODE</a>, will help us to be able to interpret all the other variations that may play a role in cancer and other diseases.</p>
