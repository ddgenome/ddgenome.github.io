<p>On the heels of the bad news earlier this week that the <a href="/2009/01/justice-served.html">RIAA and giant media corporations were getting the second and third spots at the Justice Department</a>, we get some good news: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200901081017DOWJONESDJONLINE000662_FORTUNE5.htm">Rep. Dick Boucher (D-VA) will be the head of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet</a>. Rep. Boucher and Rep. Ed Markey are <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/01/08/house-chairman-swap-puts-virginia-techie-in-spotlight/">swapping chairmanships</a>, with Rep. Markey getting the ostensibly more prestigious Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. It could work out for everyone though: Rep. Markey is viewed as being more green and Rep. Boucher is viewed as more of a consumer advocate. There's a good report on Rep. Boucher's record at <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticleHomePage&art_aid=97993">MediaPost</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Lessig's comments on the swap: <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/2009/01/missed_and_fantastic_news_bouc.html">missed (and fantastic) news: Boucher and Telecommunications</a>.</p>
