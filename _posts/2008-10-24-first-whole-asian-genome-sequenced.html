<p>The <a href="http://www.genomics.org.cn/en/index.php">Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI)</a> recently announced the completion of the first <a href="http://yh.genomics.org.cn/">whole genome sequence of a Han Chinese individual</a>. The genome, which they named YH, was generated from DNA donated by an individual that works at BGI. They generated over 117 Gb of data, of which nearly 103 Gb mapped back to the human reference genome, covering well over 99% of the reference. They were able to find over 3 millions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_nucleotide_polymorphism">SNP</a>s, about 135,000 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indel">indels</a>, and nearly 2700 <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070509161020.htm">structural variations</a>. You can download the sequence, browse the genome, and BLAST against the consensus on the web site.</p>
