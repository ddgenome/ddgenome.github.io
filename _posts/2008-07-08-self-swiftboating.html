<p>Lawrence Lessig has an interesting take on the recent dust up over Sen. Obama's <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/07/selfswiftboating.html">positions on campaign financing and telecom immunity</a>. In short, the Obama campaign is attacking Sen. Obama's strongest traits. I guess they don't want to be outdone on any measure by the McCain campaign (reversals on campaign finance, torture, tax cuts, off-shore oil drilling, and Iraq).</p>
