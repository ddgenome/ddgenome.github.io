<p>Well, it seems the campaign season is in full swing, you can tell by the smell of bs in the air. How can you distinguish the truth from the lies? Well, if you are like many people, the truth is everything that reinforces your world view and the lies are things that contradict your world view. If you desire a more objective definition of truth, I strongly suggest frequent visits to <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a>. They have had a flurry of updates on their main page over the past week or so (<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/factfeed.rss">RSS feed</a>). So many, in fact, that they have set up a new, rapid-fire response site, <a href="http://wire.factcheck.org/">The FactCheck Wire</a> (<a href="http://wire.factcheck.org/feed/">RSS feed</a>). You can also check out their weekly webcast, <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/justarchive/">Just the Facts!</a> Below are some of the more recent and interesting corrections.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wire.factcheck.org/2008/09/10/pigs-and-pit-bulls/">Sen. Obama called Sen. McCain's policies a pig</a>. He did not call Gov. Palin a pig. Sen. McCain himself called Sen. Clinton's health care policy a pig.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/sliming_palin.html">Gov. Palin did not ban any books while mayor of Wassila</a>, although she did explore the idea.</li>
<li>Both the <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/school_funding_misleads.html">Obama campaign</a> and the <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/off_base_on_sex_ed.html">McCain campaign</a> have ads distorting the other's education record.</li>
</ul>
