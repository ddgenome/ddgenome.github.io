<p><a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/public/department/staff-lists/profile.php?staff_id=36">Ross King</a>, a computer scientist and biologist at Aberystwyth University, has created a <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/04/03/0049237">robot that can develop and test scientific hypotheses</a>. Specifically, it was given information about the yeast genome and genes in other organisms that were involved in metabolism, then <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7984054.stm">tasked with finding genes involved in lysine production in baker's yeast</a>. The robot, Adam, was able to generate a hypothesis and design experiments to test it. The research is published in the latest issue of <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/324/5923/85"><em>Science</em></a>. Well, I guess it's time for a long vacation.</p>
