<p>Recently Nature had an editorial about the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7255/full/460551a.html">challenges presented by data intensive science</a>. Specifically, they summarized the <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12615">report of a National Academies study committee</a> formed, at Nature's and others' urging, to study the issues surrounding the rapid increase in data generation without commensurate standards and policies guiding their use and sharing. What was the result? Not much. A few recommendations: investigators should be ethical, data should be publicly available, and disciplines should provide guidelines on what data to keep and for how long. Not exactly breaking new ground here. Here is my favorite sentence in the article, <em>"data professionals should be recognized for their crucial role in stewardship: certainly they deserve more respect and support than researchers sometimes give them."</em></p>
<p>One can't help but contrast these recommendations and call for respect and support with the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=newsncbi&part=Aug09">recent announcement</a> from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</a> that the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra">Short Read Archive</a> was online, over a <a href="/2008/05/short-read-archive.html"><strong>year</strong> after it actually came online</a>. Although, truth be told, it has been a challenging year. There have been issues with disk space and the Aspera software. It seems several aspects of the processing of data submissions are still manual. And, perhaps worst of all, people no longer want the data they are storing. Researchers no longer want <a href="/2008/06/whats-in-an-srf.html">SRF</a> (raw sequence) files, they want <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/">BAM</a> (reads already assembled or aligned to a reference sequence) file. In other words, just as the SRA has much of their system set up to accept and process SRF files, they need to set up a system to accept and process BAM files.180 3 GB chunks </p>
