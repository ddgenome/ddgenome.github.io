<p>The Genome Data Center has received a <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19">Gold LEED Certification</a> from the <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/">U.S. Green Building Council</a>. This is in addition to the <a href="/2008/11/keystone-award-for-data-center.html">Keystone Award</a> from the St. Louis Association of General Contractors. It is quite an achievement for a power hungry data center to receive a LEED certification, much more a Gold Certification, but the WUSM Design and Construction team along with the architects, engineers, and contractors were able to pull it off.</p>
<p>Recently the final phase of construction at the Genome Data Center was completed. The initial build out had enough power and cooling for about 40 racks of equipment. Now at full capacity, the data center is capable of supplying 4 MW of power (about the amount used by 800 homes on a hot day) and the requisite cooling to the equipment housed within it. This will support over 100 racks worth of high-density computational (blades) and storage equipment and its supporting infrastructure (chilled water plants, air handlers, humidity control, office space, etc.). The electrical system is completely redundant, all the way to the double-ended substation of our electrical utility. That means even if we lose one entire electrical feed, we can still operate on utility power. If we lose both electrical feeds, we have battery and fly-wheel UPS systems to carry us until the two 2 MW diesel generators start (under 10 seconds). <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ddgenome/3730196210/" title="2 MW diesel generator"><img src="assets/3730196210_cdb8bfeb18.jpg" width="452" height="339" alt="generator" /></a> The building is about 1480 m<sup>2</sup> while the actual data center is about 288 m<sup>2</sup> (as they shrink computing equipment, the required electrical and cooling equipment keeps increasing in size). The data center is arranged in a standard hot aisle/cold aisle layout with cooling delivered from below through floor grates (perf plates did not provide enough airflow) via a 1.2 m raised floor. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ddgenome/3730194974/" title="data center cold aisle"><img src="assets/3730194974_8fddfc00b1.jpg" width="452" height="339" alt="cold aisle" /></a> We currently have about 3,000 cores in our computational cluster and over 3 PB (3,000,000 GB) of storage online. When full of equipment in a few years, the data center will likely house tens of thousands of cores and on the order of 100 PB of storage.</p>
