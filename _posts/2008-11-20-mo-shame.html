<p>Yesterday, Missouri was called for Sen. McCain. He has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapPMO">won Missouri 1,445,812 to 1,442,180</a>; a margin of 3,632 or 0.126%. When taken at face value, it appears Sen. Obama made up a lot of ground compared to the previous Democratic presidential nominee who <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/map/past.results/">lost by 8%</a>. However, when compared to the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapGMO">results of this year's Missouri gubernatorial race</a> where Democrat Jay Nixon defeated Republican Kenny Hulshof 1,680,611 to 1,136,363, a margin of over 19%, one has to wonder about the origin of the discrepancy between the two sets of results. Nixon and Obama campaigned together in Missouri. The policy positions of Nixon and Obama are not that different, even on social issues which can turn an election in socially conservative Missouri. Was race a determining factor in the rural parts of Missouri?</p>
