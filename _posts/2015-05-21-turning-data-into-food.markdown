Our team at Monsanto recently led the charge to start an
[engineering blog][eng-blog] where we can share more about what we are
doing in IT and Technology, highlight some of our Open Source
projects, and talk a bit about our culture.  We're just getting
started but there are already a couple good posts, including the
beginning of a series by [Jorge Montero][jorge] about
[Scala's implicits][implicits].

I just published a post on how we are using
[Big Data to better understand growing plants and their environment][big-good]
so we can produce more food for an ever more populous planet.  Using
Big Data doesn't have to be just selling ads and collecting phone
records!
