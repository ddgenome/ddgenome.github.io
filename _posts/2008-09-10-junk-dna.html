<p>DNA that does not encode genes or is not in known regulatory regions has long been called "junk DNA". This junk DNA makes up over 90% of the human genome. Last year, the <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">ENCODE project</a> reported that this notion of massive portions of the DNA not serving any function was likely wrong. Rather, their findings suggested that the human genome <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070613131932.htm">is a complex network of interacting elements containing very little unused sequence</a>, not gene islands in an ocean of junk. Now, researchers at Yale have found that <a href="http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=5980">junk DNA may have triggered key evolutionary changes in the human thumb and foot</a>.</p>
