<p>It seems the publication of the <a href="/2008/11/first-whole-cancer-genome-sequenced.html">first whole cancer genome sequence</a> is getting a good reception in hematology circles. This past Saturday at the <a href="http://www.hematology.org/meetings/2008/index.cfm">50<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology</a>, <a href="http://hematology.wustl.edu/faculty/ley/leyBio.html">Dr. Tim Ley</a> presented our AML sequencing work to a packed room of over 2000 people. In fact, there was such demand to see the talk that they scheduled a second time for Dr. Ley to give the talk so that all those that were turned away the first time could get a chance to see it. There is a lot of excitement in these oncology circles because the initiating events for many of these tumors are not known and an unbiased, whole-genome sequencing approach is currently the best chance to discover them.</p>
