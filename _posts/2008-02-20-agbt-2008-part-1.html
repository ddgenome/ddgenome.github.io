<p>I have been meaning to write about what I saw at the <a href="http://www.agbt.org/flash/about.html">Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT)</a> meeting a couple weeks ago, but have not had time to sit and generate a long post.  So I will try to post several shorter entries as I get time.</p>
<p>The best session at AGBT was on Saturday afternoon, Future Horizons in Genome Exploration (chaired by my boss <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/Bio/MardisBIO.cgi">Elaine Mardis</a>).  It started with an entertaining talk by Stephan Schuster about the mammoth genome.  Mammoths are about as close to modern-day elephants as humans are to chimps.  John Leamon from <a href="http://www.raindancetechnologies.com/">RainDance Technologies</a> gave a talk on their very cool microfluidics platform, complete with cool <a href="http://www.raindancetechnologies.com/formulate.html">movies</a> (yes, movies not animations).  The session ended with a presentation by <a href="http://www.pacificbiosciences.com/">Pacific Biosciences</a> Founder and CTO Stephen Turner about their single molecule, real time sequencing platform.  Think about sequencing an entire human genome to tenfold redundancy in a matter of hours.  That's a lot of data to analyze and store.</p>
