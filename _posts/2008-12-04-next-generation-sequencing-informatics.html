<p>I have put together a table with a bunch of important metrics for the major next-generation sequencing platforms: <a href="/next-generation-sequencing-informatics">Next-Generation Sequencing Informatics</a> (there is also a link on the left-hand side of the page). It includes number of reads, read length, data sizes, computational time, etc. I will try to keep it as up to date as I can and add new platforms and revisions as they become available. Consider it an early Christmas present.</p>
