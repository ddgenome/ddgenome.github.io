<p>For those of you following my recent posts posts on <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/2008/04/senate-passes-gina.html">GINA</a> and its <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/2008/05/do-laws-protect-rights.html">ramifications</a>, you might be interested to know that <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080526152654.htm">President Bush signed GINA into law</a> last week.  Sorry for not updating you sooner.</p>
