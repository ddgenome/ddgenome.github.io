<p>To begin to wash off all the <a href="/2009/06/the-evil-that-scientists-do.html">evil that scientists do</a>, why not do some good by helping a worthy charity like the <a href="http://www.crisisnurserykids.com/">St. Louis Crisis Nursery</a>. The Crisis Nursery has <a href="http://www.crisisnurserykids.com/annual_events.htm">several events coming up</a>. There are wine tastings on June 18, 2009 in Chesterfield, MO (see <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/stlcn-wine.pdf">details (pdf)</a>) and on June 25, 2009 in St. Charles County. On August 20, 2009, the Nursery will host its annual Celebrity Waiters' and Waitresses' Night at <a href="http://www.billcardwell.com/cardwells.html">Cardwell's</a> and <a href="http://www.canyoncafe.com/mostlouis.htm">Canyon Caf&eacute;</a> in <a href="http://www.plazafrontenac.com/">Plaza Frontenac</a>. Or, you can just <a href="https://app.etapestry.com/hosted/StLouisCrisisNursery/OnlineGiving.html">donate some of your ill-gotten gains</a>.</p>
