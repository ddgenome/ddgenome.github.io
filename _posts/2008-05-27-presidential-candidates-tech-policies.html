<p>Ars Technica is running a piece on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080527-mccain-and-obama-tech-policy-at-cfp.html">Sens. McCain and Obama's positions on issues important to the tech community</a>.  More specifically, the piece covers a forum with technology representatives from each of their campaigns.  These issues likely will not see the light of day in any presidential debates, so read up when you can.</p>
