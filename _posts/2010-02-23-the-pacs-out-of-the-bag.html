<p>Most of you have probably already seen this, but <a href="http://www.pacificbiosciences.com/">Pacific Biosciences</a> announced the <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/02/speedy-prototype-gene-decoders-sold/?boxes=businesschannelsections">institutions that will be getting their first ten prototype instruments</a> (<a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/2010/02/23/pacbio-customers.html">Bio-IT World</a>, <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/pacbio-names-first-10-customers-695000-single-molecule-sequencer-first-shipments">GenomeWeb</a>, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pacific-biosciences-announces-early-access-customers-for-its-single-molecule-real-time-system-2010-02-23?reflink=MW_news_stmp">MarketWatch</a>). <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a> is among the institutions that will be getting one. It looks like PacBio will indeed be the first third generation sequencing company with instruments out in the wild. Don't get too excited though, it's probable that these third generation instruments will be a lot like the first batch of second generation instruments: it will take a while before they are ready for production sequencing, reliably producing good quality data. We'll find out more from all the sequencing instrument companies in the coming days at <a href="http://www.agbt.org/">AGBT</a>.</p>
