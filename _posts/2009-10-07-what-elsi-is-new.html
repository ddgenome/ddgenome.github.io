<p>My contribution to the Genomics Law Report's <a href="http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/category/featured-content/what-elsi-is-new/">What ELSI is New?</a> series appears today, <a href="http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2009/10/07/personalized-medicine-leave-u-s-behind/">Personalized medicine, leave U.S. behind</a>. The piece discusses the challenges our current health care system presents to genetic research and proposed reforms that would improve the situation.</p>
<p>For the record, while this opinion piece was just published, I did write it before <a href="http://crossborderbiotech.ca/2009/09/30/in-praise-of-universal-coverage-from-a-fan-of-personalized-medicine/">this similar piece</a> appeared.</p>
