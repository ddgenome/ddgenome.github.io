<p>I'm moving.  Well, at least my blog is moving.  PolITiGenomics is moving to its own domain.  Check out the new home, <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/">www.politigenomics.com</a>.  The <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Politigenomics">RSS feed URL</a> should be unaffected, but you may see a deluge of "new" posts since the URLs of all the posts have changed.</p>
