<p>Last Friday, the Friday before the the three day Memorial Day weekend, Sen. McCain made his health records for the last eight years (over 1,200 pages!) available for just three hours to journalists who were not allowed to use the internet or cell phones, make copies, or leave the room while they reviewed them. Despite finding quite a few ailments, he has been declared "fit as a fiddle" by the press. The Daily Show has an entertaining take on this act of political theater.</p>
