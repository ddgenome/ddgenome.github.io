<blockquote><p><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: xx-small;">16</span>"Tell this to the nations,<br />
proclaim it to Jerusalem:<br />
'A besieging army is coming from a distant land,<br />
raising a war cry against the cities of Judah.</p>
<p><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: xx-small;">17</span>They surround her like men guarding a field,<br />
because she has rebelled against me,' "<br />
declares the LORD.</p>
<p><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: xx-small;">18</span>"Your own conduct and actions<br />
have brought this upon you.<br />
This is your punishment.<br />
How bitter it is!<br />
How it pierces to the heart!"</p>
<p>Jeremiah 4:16-18 (NIV)</p></blockquote>
