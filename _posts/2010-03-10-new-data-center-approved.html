<p><a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a> recently received word that its <a href="http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/20393.aspx">grant proposal for a data center was approved</a> (<a href="http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2010/03/08/daily45.html?surround=etf&ana=e_article">St. Louis Business Journal</a>). The $14.3 million grant is funded by <a href="http://http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/">National Center for Research Resources</a> and the money comes from <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/">ARRA</a>. The grant, along with about $8 million dollars from <a href="http://www.wustl.edu/">Washington University</a>, will allow us to essentially duplicate our <a href="/2009/10/expansion.html">current data center</a> capacity. We took possession of our current data center in May 2008 and it is already 80-90% full, so this new data center will greatly help us to keep pace with all of the <a href="http://www.pediatriccancergenomeproject.org/site/">exciting, new projects</a> we are undertaking.</p>
