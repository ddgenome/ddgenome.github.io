<p>Super Tuesday is tomorrow and my state, Missouri, will be participating.  Missouri has open primaries.  This means when you arrive at your polling place, you are asked whether you want the Democratic or Republican ballot.  If you don't know where your polling place is, you can <a href="http://mcvr.mo.gov/PollingPlaceLookup/">look it up here</a>.  You will need <a href="http://www.sos.mo.gov/elections/voterid/default.asp">some form of identification</a> to vote (it does not need to be a picture ID, a utility bill will work).  It's easy, so get out and vote!</p>
