<p>Despite talk of the power of all those small donors, it seems, not surprisingly, that big money has not lost all influence in Washington. President-elect Obama has selected one of the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10133425-38.html">RIAA's favorite lawyers, Tom Perrelli, for Associate Attorney General</a> (the number three spot at the Justice Department). Not only that, the Deputy Attorney General (the number two position at Justice) is set to be filled by David Ogden, who's department at Justice (when he was there in the Clinton administration) defended the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act in front of the Supreme Court; against a challenge led by <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a>. These appointments are a huge win for large, multimedia corporations and a huge blow to fair use. Hopefully Prof. Lessig will respond soon on his <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">blog</a>. In the meantime, perhaps you should head over to <a href="http://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> and support the proposal for <a href="http://www.change.org/ideas/view/citizens_funding_of_the_nations_elections">citizens' funding of elections</a>.</p>
