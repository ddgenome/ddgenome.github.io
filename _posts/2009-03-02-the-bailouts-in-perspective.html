<p>I hesitated to post this last week because it is not directly related to the majority of content on this blog but I decided the financial situation has enough to do with politics to post (mainly because of all the political posturing and blame going around). The story, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101224460">Taxpayer Beware: Bank Bailout Will Hurt</a> takes a more balanced and nuanced approach to this very complex issue. In essence, there is plenty of blame to go around. Or, as <a href="http://www.jayfarrar.net/">Jay Farrar</a> might say, "You can hang the blame on the wall, there'd be a frame around us all." For a more in depth explanation of the current financial situation, listen to the most recent <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a> episode, <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=375">Bad Bank</a>, by the same reporters. They promise "The collapse of the banking system explained, in just 59 minutes", and they deliver.</p>
<p>For some entertainment, you can watch the video below of all the talking heads telling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schiff">Peter Schiff</a> how wrong he was about the housing market, credit market, stocks, and the recession.</p>
