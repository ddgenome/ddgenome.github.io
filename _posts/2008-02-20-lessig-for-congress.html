<p><a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a>, Law professor at Stanford, is <a href="http://lessig08.org/">considering</a> running for <a href="http://stanford.facebook.com/group.php?gid=13417986140&amp;ref=nf">Congress</a>.  The Congressional seat for his district is open due to the unfortunate <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/home?wid=10&amp;func=viewSubmission&amp;sid=3200">recent passing of Congressman Tom Lantos</a> (who had recently announced his <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/01/my_congressman_is_retiring.html">retirement</a>).  He is currently working on starting a Change Congress movement to push further ethics and lobbying reform and is trying to decide whether running for Congress fits with that goal.</p>
