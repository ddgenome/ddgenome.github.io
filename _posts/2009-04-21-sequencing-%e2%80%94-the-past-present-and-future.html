<p>Science Magazine has a nice article, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/products/lst_20090410.dtl">Sanger Who? Sequencing the Next Generation</a>, describing past sequencing technology, the current "next-generation" sequencing instruments and their capabilities, and several of the companies working to become the next big thing in sequencing. If you are interested in learning, at a high level, how each of the technologies work and how they compare to each other, it is worth a read.</p>
