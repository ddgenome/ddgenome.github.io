<p>There is a good story in The New York Times about the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R statistical programming language</a> entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?_r=1">Data Analysts Captivated by R’s Power</a>. Analysts are using R more and more at <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>. An entertaining quote in the article comes from R's competition:<br />
<blockquote>“I think it addresses a niche market for high-end data analysts that want free, readily available code," said Anne H. Milley, director of technology product marketing at SAS. She adds, “We have customers who build engines for aircraft. I am happy they are not using freeware when I get on a jet.”</p></blockquote>
<p> Is there anyone who still does not see through this <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/FUD.html">FUD</a> from proprietary software companies when talking about their free software competitors? Oh, and it's not "freeware", it's <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">free software</a>.</p>
