<p>I recently did an interview in advance of my talk at the <a href="http://www.healthtech.com/xgn">XGen Congress</a> next month in San Diego. The interview is about 14 minutes and discusses our work at <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a> in general and more specifically the software and IT infrastructure we have created to enable the analysis of the massive amounts of sequence data we generate. The interview is available to download as part of the <a href="http://www.healthtech.com/Conferences_Overview.aspx?ekfrm=97046">XGen Congress podcast series</a>.</p>
