<p>Now everyone will know about my secret past before I joined The Genome Center: <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/2009/09/16/NGS-dooling.html">David Dooling: Gangbusters at the Genome Center</a>. Bio-IT World also has a nice <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/NGS-Brown.html">interview with Clive Brown</a> of <a href="http://www.nanoporetech.com/">Oxford Nanopore</a>, whom <em>I</em> first described as the <a href="/2009/08/another-rich-white-guy-sequences-own-genome.html">most honest guy in all of next-gen sequencing</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, sorry for the extended absence, things have been crazy.</p>
