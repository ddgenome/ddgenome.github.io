<p>I was reading <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/03/09/1834238">Slashdot</a> recently and came across this story about <a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/adaptive_complexity/bad_science_journalism_and_the_myth_of_the_oppressed_underdog">bad science journalism</a>.  More specifically it talks about how the media glorifies the scientific underdog and often mischaracterizes or misunderstands the skepticism inherent in the scientific process (of all people, shouldn't journalists understand skepticism?).  It is an interesting read.</p>
<p>What is equally interesting (to me) is that it is written by <a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/profile/mwhite74">Michael White</a> who happens to be a fellow researcher here at Washington University in St. Louis.  In fact, the lab he works in is part of the <a href="http://genomesciences.wustl.edu/">Center for Genome Sciences</a> which is <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>'s upstairs neighbor.  Michael has his own blog, <a href="http://adaptivecomplexity.blogspot.com/">Adaptive Complexity</a>, so check it out.</p>
