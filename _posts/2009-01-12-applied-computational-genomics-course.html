<p>I thought some people who read this blog might be interested in the <a href="http://www.gcbioinformatics.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=18&Itemid=61">Appled Computational Genomics Course (ACGC)</a> offered by <a href="http://www.genomecanada.ca/\"">Genome Canada</a>. It teaches the basics of UNIX, <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, and several bioinformatics and sequence annotation tools. The next course is in the Spring of 2009 but has no location or dates (perhaps they meant Spring 2010). The course with an actual location (University of Calgary) is July 14-20, 2009. Canada should be nice that time of year. One course and you're riding the wave of personal genomics.</p>
