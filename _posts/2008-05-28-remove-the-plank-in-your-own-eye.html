<p>There was an interesting quote during the dust up around Sen. Obama's recent comments about <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/05/28/rnc-hits-obama-over-auschwitz-claim/">his uncle helping to liberate the Auschwitz concentration camp</a> (actually it was his great uncle that helped to liberate one of the concentration camps at Buchenwald). Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant said Obama's comments "raise questions about his judgment and his readiness to lead as commander in chief." This from a party who is fielding a <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/03/18/a_mccain_gaffe_in_jordan.html">candidate who can't keep Sunni and Shia straight</a>, on <em><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-brooks22-2008may22,0,2236437.column">multiple occasions</a></em>. Given that before a couple days ago 99.9% of Americans could not have told you that the Soviets liberated Auschwitz (and 99% probably still can't) and, according to every politician, Muslim extremist terrorists are the #1 threat to the United States, whose "judgment and readiness" are more in question?</p>
