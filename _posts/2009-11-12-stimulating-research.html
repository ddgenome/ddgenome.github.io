<p>Yesterday on NPR there was a story that <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120324815">questioned the utility of using stimulus funds for <em>long-term</em> research</a>. I am not sure exactly why they use the phrase "long-term" since all of the <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/home.aspx">American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA)</a> funds need to be spent within two years; perhaps two years is long-term thinking nowadays. In any event, as a recipient of a <a href="http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/15027.html">significant amount of ARRA funds</a>, I can say that we have spent a lot of the money, have hired a bunch of people, and have <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/careers/">plans to hire several more</a>. That's what was supposed to happen, right? Where's the problem? People are quick to criticize but no one seems to have a better mechanism for spending a lot of money very quickly. Without going through existing channels like research and transportation funding, the money would have taken a <em>lot</em> longer to get out and likely would not have the long term benefits that this spending will have.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/blog/spend-money-faster-people">The Daily Scan</a> picked up this story. Since they posted the story two days after it aired, they probably first saw it here but for some reason did not feel the need to link here (they often link to both the original story and the blog where they picked up the link). This is not the first time that has happened. Perhaps I have offended them somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Update2:</strong> The above was a tongue-in-cheek comment about The Daily Scan. It was not intended as an indication that I really think they are snubbing me. There are many legitimate reasons for their delay in posting the NPR story.</p>
