<p>I've been getting a lot of spam comments on the blog so I added a <a href="http://www.captcha.net/">CAPTCHA</a> to comment posting.  Specifically, I have added CAPTCHA's from the <a href="http://recaptcha.net/whyrecaptcha.html">reCAPTCHA project</a> which uses CAPTCHA's to help digitize old books.  Adding the CAPTCHA's was greatly facilitated by the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-recaptcha/">WordPress reCAPTCHA plugin</a>. So rest assured, every time you post a comment, you are helping to enlarge the freely available intellectual commons.</p>
