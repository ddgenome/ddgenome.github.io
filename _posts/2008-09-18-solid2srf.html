<p>In a previous post, I discussed the <a href="/2008/06/whats-in-an-srf.html">sequence read format (SRF)</a>, the implementation of the <a href="http://srf.sourceforge.net/">SRF specification</a> for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=100316&package_id=108243">Illumina/Solexa data</a>, and potential implementations for Roche/454 and AB SOLiD data. Well, the potential AB SOLiD implementation has become an actual implementation with the release of <a href="http://solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/srf/">solid2srf</a> version 0.6.6. The software is released under the <a href="http://download.solidsoftwaretools.com/license/SIPP_LICENSE.pdf">Applied Biosystems SOLiD&trade; Tools Software License (Unsupported) license [pdf]</a>, which appears to be an open source license.
