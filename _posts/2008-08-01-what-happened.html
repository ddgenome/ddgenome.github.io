<p>This election, in this year where we have a struggling economy, high energy prices, housing woes, and two wars, we were promised a campaign that focused on big differences on big issues. Sen. McCain promised a <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/editorials/stories/DN-mccain_01edi.ART.State.Edition1.4dd2edb.html">respectful campaign</a>. What we have gotten is a media focused on minutiae and candidates bickering back and forth about nonsense. The McCain campaign is complaining about the amount of media coverage Sen. Obama is receiving (even though the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-onthemedia27-2008jul27,0,6802141.story">majority (72%) of the coverage was negative</a>), <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/a_full_tank_of_nonsense.html">blaming Sen. Obama for high gas prices</a>, spreading <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/snubbing_wounded_troops.html">false information</a> about <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25893783/">Sen. Obama's cancelled visit with the troops</a> (which was later retracted by the campaign blogger), <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/mccain_links_castro_with_obama.html">linking Sen. Obama and Fidel Castro</a>, and, perhaps most <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/obamas_celebrity_cred.html">ridiculously</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080102965.html">comparing Sen. Obama to "celebrities"</a> (apparently <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/07/paris-hilton-mc.html">angering the Hilton's who have contributed over $50,000 to his cause</a>). Doesn't anyone running for president qualify as a celebrity? And now, they are sniping back and forth about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/us/politics/01campaign.html?em">the race card</a>, or is it <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/obamas_celebrity_cred.html">the 'race card' card</a>? Either way, it seems <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/">Sen. McCain</a> and <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/01/26/for_bill_clinton_echoes_of_jac.html">Sen. Obama</a> have short memories when it comes to race and politics.</p>
<p>As usual, The Daily Show has a humorous take on recent events.</p>
