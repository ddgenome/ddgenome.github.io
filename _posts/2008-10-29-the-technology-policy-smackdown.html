<p>Tomorrow, 30 October 2008, at 12:30 EDT, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, representing Sen. McCain, and former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, representing Sen. Obama, will participate in a <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/events/2008/tech_smackdown">Technology Policy Smackdown</a> hosted by the <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/">New America Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired Magazine</a>. It is a pretty lame name for a discussion of the candidates' tech agendas, but it should be interesting. The debate will be webcast live starting at 12:25 EDT (see above link for more details).</p>
