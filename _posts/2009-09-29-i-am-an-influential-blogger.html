<p>John Travis contacted me to let me know about a recent article of his at ScienceInsider about the <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/09/border-agencys.html">UK's plans to use DNA and isotope analysis to determine the nationality of people entering the country seeking asylum</a> (<a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/09/nationality-tes.html">Q&A</a>). Such a program is truly unbelievable in its scope and irony. I can imagine the conversation at the border: "You want asylum from an overreaching government? Well let me bank your DNA. I <em>promise</em> I will only use it to verify your nationality. Trust me." For further, more insightful commentary, see Daniel MacArthur's post <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/09/outrage_over_dna_testing_for_u.php">Outrage over DNA testing for UK asylum seekers</a> (wisely, John Travis also seems to have contacted Daniel, a truly influential blogger).</p>
