<p>There is a story about regional data centers in the <a href="http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/archives/2010/issue1/">Jan/Feb 2010 issue of St. Louis Commerce Magazine</a> that includes a section on our Genome Data Center; the only regional data center to achieve <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/LEED/">LEED</a> certification (and gold at that!). Unfortunately, the issue seems to only be available as part of a Flash application, so I cannot link to the story, only to the <a href="http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/archives/2010/issue1/">issue</a> and tell you that the data center story starts on page 62 and the Genome Data Center section is on page 64 (it includes <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ddgenome/sets/72157603633991423/">pictures</a>!). This issue of the magazine also includes stories on cloud computing and Washington University in St. Louis Chancellor <a href="http://www.wustl.edu/wrighton/">Mark Wrighton</a> (and high-speed rail of course).</p>
