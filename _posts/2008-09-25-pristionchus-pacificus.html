<p>Have you ever wanted to learn more about parasitic roundworms that feast on the bacteria, fungi and other small roundworms that grow on beetle carcasses after they have died? Well, today is your lucky day. We have just published a paper in Nature Genetics about the genome sequence of <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Pristionchus%20pacificus%20var.%20california"><em>Pristionchus pacificus</em></a> entitled <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.227.html">The <em>Pristionchus pacificus</em> genome provides a unique perspective on nematode lifestyle and parasitism</a>. At this point you may be asking yourself, "What does <em>P. pacificus</em> do while the beetle is alive?" Interestingly, it exists in a dormant, resting state while the beetle is still alive to conserve energy while food is scarce. For a less technical discussion of the findings of the journal article, see <a href="http://mednews.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/12490.html">Worm genome offers clues to evolution of parasitism</a>.</p>
