<p>If you are going to be at <a href="http://www.healthtech.com/xgn">XGen</a> next week and you are interested in cloud computing and its application to bioinformatics, be sure to stop and participate in the <a href="http://www.healthtech.com/conferences_track_overview.aspx?id=96211"><em>Cloud Computing in Bioinformatics</em> discussion I will be "facilitating" on Wednesday morning (March 17)</a>. My talk is at 3:05 p.m. PT on <a href="http://www.healthtech.com/conferences_track_overview.aspx?id=95412">Tuesday</a> and I will be chairing the first session on <a href="http://www.healthtech.com/xgn/sdw/">Monday</a> (if my plane is on time and the taxi is fast enough).</p>
