<p>According to Forbes, personal genomics will be <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/07/firstsolar-ibm-cambrios-leadership-clayton-in-cx_jw_0106claytonchristensen_inl.html">one of the five technologies that will shape the next decade</a>. They predict (not too boldly) that personal genome sequencing will become widely available and pave the way to personalized medicine. I wonder where <a href="/2008/11/first-whole-cancer-genome-sequenced.html">they would get an idea like that</a>? They mention <a href="http://www.pacificbiosciences.com/">Pacific Biosciences</a>, <a href="http://www.knome.com/">Knome</a> (George Church), and venture capital darling <a href="http://www.completegenomics.com/">Complete Genomics</a> as players in this field. They somehow fail to mention privacy concerns or informatics/IT challenges. I guess that's what you get from a business publication.</p>
