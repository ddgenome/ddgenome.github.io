<p>Just wanted to let everyone know that <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a> is now on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Genome-Center-at-Washington-University/107175642653384?ref=ts">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/TheGenomeCenter">Twitter</a>. So become a fan a listen to our tweets (immediately after typing that sentence I got the overwhelming feeling that I am an old dork who uses hipster jargon to try to sound cool).</p>
