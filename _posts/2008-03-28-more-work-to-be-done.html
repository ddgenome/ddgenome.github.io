<p>A significant amount of effort in genomics over the past year has focused on cancer-related sequencing.  However, as a recent story on the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89163694">role of genetics in schizophrenia</a> demonstrates, there are many conditions that have a devastating impact on human health that, if not diseases of the genome, are greatly affected by an individual's genome.  The <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/">1000 Genomes Project</a> will lay a significant foundation for studying the role of the genome in such conditions.  In addition, the <a href="http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/">Human Microbiome Project</a> will help us understand the many genomes that our bodies depend on to live.  Add to that continued sequencing of interesting comparative genomes and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen">pathogen</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_%28biology%29">vector</a> genomes and you come up with a comprehensive plan for applying the science of genomics to human health; a springboard for better understanding of schizophrenia, <a href="http://www.genome.gov/25522099">autism</a>, <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10001217">Parkinson's disease</a>, and <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10001204">many more diseases</a>.</p>
