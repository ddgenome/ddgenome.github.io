<p>Sorry for the late notice, but I will be giving a presentation tomorrow (Wednesday) night at the <a href="http://stlouis.pm.org/">St. Louis Perl Mongers</a> meeting. The meeting starts at 6:30 p.m. CST on the 5th floor of the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=4444+Forest+Park+Ave,+St.+Louis,+MO&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=us&ei=922bSeKlF5i2MaGQ5Z4F&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&resnum=1&ct=title">4444 Forest Park</a> building (one floor above The Genome Center). I will be talking about what we do at <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>, our software and IT infrastructure, and how we are working toward a more complete understanding of cancer genomics. It should be interesting&hellip; to see if I am able to put the talk together in time. All are welcome, I hope to see you there.</p>
