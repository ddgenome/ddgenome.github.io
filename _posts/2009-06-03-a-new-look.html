<p>In case you haven't noticed, we rolled out our new web site, <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">genome.wustl.edu</a>, yesterday. Much of the content is the same, but it has a whole new design and navigational structure. The design will likely be familiar to you if you have seen someone from The Genome Center give a talk in the last year or so. Along with the navigational changes, we have added some feature-like content (including videos) that we hope will make the site more accessible to the non-scientific community.  Most of the old site now sits under the <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/collaborate/">Collaborate section</a>. There are a few applications that have not been migrated yet, but they are still available via the old site through links on the new. If you notice any problems, be sure to let us know.</p>
<p>The site was designed and implemented by <a href="http://www.paradowski.com/">Paradowski Creative</a>.</p>
