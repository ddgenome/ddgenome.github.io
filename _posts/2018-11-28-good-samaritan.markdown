On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.
"Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

"What is written in the Law?" he replied.  "How do you read it?"

He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and,
'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"

"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied.  "Do this and you will
live."

But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my
neighbor?"

In reply Jesus said: "A caravan was going from Central America to the
United States, when they were covered by reporters.  They broadcast
the plight of the caravan, their violent and poverty-stricken origins,
and left them to continue walking.  A President heard this and, seeing
he could score political points, sent military troops to the border.
So too, local officials, when the caravan arrived in their town,
corralled them in a small stadium. When the caravan went to the
border, border officials shut down the border.  Seeing they would not
be dissuaded, they also sprayed them with tear gas.

"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the caravan?"

The expert in the law replied, "No one."

Jesus told him, "Go and do better."
