<p>I have made some updates to the <a href="/next-generation-sequencing-informatics">Next-Generation Sequencing Informatics table</a>. Specifically, I have updated the numbers for 454 Ti, including paired-end information, and added information on the Illumina GA IIx. If anyone that is not employed by AB has real-world numbers for SOLiD 3, I'd appreciate you passing them along to me (I'm looking at you drd).</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I received some SOLiD 3 number from Nicholas Socci (thanks Nicholas!).</p>
<p><strong>Update2:</strong> I received a fuller set of numbers from drd and the SOLiD 3 column is complete (thanks drd!).</p>
