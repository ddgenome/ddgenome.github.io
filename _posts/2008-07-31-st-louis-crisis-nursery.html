<p>Recently I was asked to join the Young Professionals Board of the <a href="http://www.crisisnurserykids.org/">St. Louis Crisis Nursery</a>.  The Nursery is a terrific organization that provides safe, short-term shelter for children whose parents are in crisis.  It is the only organization in St. Louis and one of the few in the country dedicated to preventing child abuse and neglect. It does this by taking a holistic and individually tailored approach to each family's situation, partnering with other area organizations to help parents get their situations back under control.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, the Nursery has different events to raise awareness of its mission and to raise money so it can meet the needs of parents in the community. Today, 31 July 2008, the <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a> store in <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/calendars/TAC.html">Town &amp; Country is donating 5% of their sales to the Nursery</a>. There will be fun activities throughout the store for children and they will also be having a baby food and baby care products drive for the Nursery. The store is near the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1160+Town+and+Country+Crossing+Drive,+Town+and+Country,+MO+63017&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=53.432436,70.3125&ie=UTF8&ll=38.63044,-90.51491&spn=0.013008,0.017166&z=16">intersection of 141 and Clayton</a>, so if you are in the area stop by and do your grocery shopping.</p>
<p>On August 21<sup>st</sup>, the Nursery will have its annual <a href="http://www.crisisnurserykids.org/annual_events.htm">Celebrity Waiters & Waitresses Night</a> at <a href="http://www.monarchrestaurant.com/">Monarch Restaurant</a> in Maplewood. All the tips collected that evening go to the Nursery. Call 314-644-3995 to make make a reservation today.</p>
