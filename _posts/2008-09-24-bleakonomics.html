<p>If you are interested in a good summary of the current financial crisis and how it is likely to play out over the coming days and months, I would recommend you watch <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09192008/watch2.html">Bill Moyers' interview of Kevin Phillips</a>. If you are interested in how the current crisis is playing out in the presidential campaign, I would recommend <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=5849844">the round table discussion from This Week</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> You can find a marked-up version of the <a href="http://www.publicmarkup.org/bill/legislative-proposal-treasury-department-authority/">original Treasury Department's bailout bill</a> and <a href="http://publicmarkup.org/bill/dodds-legislative-proposal-treasury-department-aut/">Sen. Dodd's bill</a> at <a href="http://publicmarkup.org/">PublicMarkup.org</a>.</p>
