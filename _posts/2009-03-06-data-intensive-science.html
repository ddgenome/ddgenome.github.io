<p>There is an interesting article, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/323/5919/1297">Beyond the Data Deluge</a>, on Science that discusses how various scientific disciplines are facing massive increases in data generation rates and how they are dealing with it. The article has several useful references for those interested in learning more. It seems the authors worked closely with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gray/">Jim Gray</a>, who <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/news/featurestories/publish/Gray.aspx">went missing</a> while sailing about two years ago.</p>
