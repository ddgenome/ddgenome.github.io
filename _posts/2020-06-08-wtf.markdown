Today, the Washington Post posted a detailed timeline of the most
remarkable abuse of power by a President of the United States I have
witnessed in my lifetime: [The crackdown before Trumpâ€™s photo
op][wapo].  In short, after declaring himself "the law and order
President" (that ended well for Richard Nixon, right?), the head of
the executive branch used police, the military, the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, and park rangers (park rangers!) to violently displace
largely peaceful protesters from in front of a historical church to
take a photo with _a_ Bible.  How is willfully and intentionally
violating the First Amendment rights of citizens by the President, who
is sworn to uphold the Constitution, not a bigger story?  I know there
is a lot going on, but have we become so inured to bad behavior from
this President that what by any other President at any other time
would be an impeachable offense is largely ignored?
