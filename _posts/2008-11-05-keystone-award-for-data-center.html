<p><a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>'s new Data Center Building won the prestigious (I'm told) Keystone Award for Project of the Year from the St. Louis Association of General Contractors. This award is given to construction projects in the St. Louis area for building excellence in the fields of safety, constructibility, speed, budget, etc.</p>
