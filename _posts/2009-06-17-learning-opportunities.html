<p>These links came to my attention this past weekend and I thought they might be of use to some of the readers here. First, you can access all course materials, even lectures, for the <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp08/">CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> course at UC Berkeley. The course comes highly recommended. Second, Melissa Kahney has aggregated links for a bunch of <a href="http://educhoices.org/articles/Useful_Tutorials_on_Linux_and_UNIX_for_Beginners_and_Experts_Alike.html">UNIX and GNU/Linux tutorials</a> grouped by topic and target audience (beginner and expert).</p>
