<p>It's been a long while since I posted, undoubtedly a bit too long for many to even be paying attention any more. I have a few ideas kicking around in my head where a blog post is likely a better forum than <a href="https://twitter.com/ddgenome">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/113540759007363012961/posts">Google+</a>. Until I wrestle them out, check out this article about some rewarding work we did last year to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/health/in-gene-sequencing-treatment-for-leukemia-glimpses-of-the-future.html?pagewanted=all">help treat a colleague's cancer recurrence</a>. Below is a short video about the effort.</p>
