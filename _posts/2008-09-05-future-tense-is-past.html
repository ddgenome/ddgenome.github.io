<p>After watching the two major party conventions this last two weeks, it seems Americans have a choice between two parties that both have a tenuous relationship with the present. The Democratic Party thinks only about tomorrow, and only if Sen. Obama is elected. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/us/politics/05assess.html?_r=1&hp=&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1220587827-kkuSttVEG3l6VqQH3RA/Og">Republican Party seems to have forgotten that they were in charge the last eight years</a>. Each night of their convention, the RNC speakers railed continuously against the broken politics of Washington and the "do nothing" Congress. Have they forgotten that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-l-borosage/congress-the-roots-of-obs_b_115669.html">Presidential vetoes and Senate filibusters</a> are largely responsible for the current situation there? The current set of <a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/72357">Senate Republicans are on track to use the filibuster or threat of a filibuster</a> more than any other Senate minority party in history. More than that, it was their stated intention to do exactly this after losing the Senate majority in 2006; as Sen. Lott said shortly after the election, they are going to filibuster "everything that moves."</p>
<p>Below are The Daily Show and Colbert Report takes from last night. To get to the meat, skip to about the 6 minute mark on The Daily Show clip and watch the first 5:30 of the Colbert clip.</p>

<p>Here's one thing I don't understand: why the knock on community organizers? The Republicans want the federal government out of local business. They want local people to have a say over local issues. So why <a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/godspolitics/2008/09/palin-owes-some-good-people-an.html">belittle people who are trying to do just that</a>?</p>
