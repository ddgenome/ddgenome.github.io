<p><a href="http://www.fareedzakaria.com/">Fareed Zakaria</a> is one of those rare news analysts that has a deep understanding of issues and is able to distill complex topics into their most salient points. Early this past November, nearly two months before the Senate even passed a bill, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/221611">Mr. Zakaria's column in Newsweek</a> had this to say about the health care overhaul.<br />
<blockquote>There are two great health-care crises in America&mdash;one involving coverage and the other cost. The Obama plan appears likely to tackle the first but not the second. This is bad economics but also bad politics: the crisis of cost affects 85 percent of Americans, while the crisis of coverage affects about 15 percent. Obama's message to the country appears to be "We have a dysfunctional health-care system with out-of-control costs, and let's add 45 million people to it."</p></blockquote>
<p> With the recent passage of the Senate's bill, one that expands coverage but does nothing to control costs, his statement is even more true. So why is the cost of health care not getting adequately addressed? Because there are large corporations that are making huge sums of money from the system as it currently exists and they are willing to spend a small fraction of their earnings to "convince" lawmakers that their continued profiteering is good for those lawmakers, er, America.</p>
