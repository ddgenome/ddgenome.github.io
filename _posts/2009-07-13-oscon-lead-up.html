<p>Last week I did an interview with <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/jamest/">James Turner</a> at <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> about my <a href="/2009/04/oscon-2009.html">upcoming talk at OSCON</a>. It turns out that James is a bit of a genomics nut and therefore had a lot of insightful questions about the current state of genomics and health. Hopefully my responses were as good as his questions. You can judge for yourself by listening to the interview or reading the transcript: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/07/sequencing-a-genome-a-week.html">Sequencing a Genome a Week</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The story has been posted on <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/07/13/2129229/Sequencing-a-Human-Genome-In-a-Week">Slashdot</a>.</p>
