<p>Now that we are three weeks away from the election, the polls are actually worth looking at (that is, of course, if you are interested in that sort of thing). The <a href="http://www.gallup.com/">Gallup Daily Tracking Poll</a> is updated daily at about 1 p.m. EDT. <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/election2008/2008-election-map.html#/president-nprOvM/">NPR</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/map/polling/index.html">CNN</a> have interactive maps with the current state of the Electoral College. If you are more interested in multiple polls being mashed together into some unholy algorithm to produce a prediction, check out <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/">RealClearPolitics</a>, and <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/">Electoral-vote.com</a>. They are each also updated daily with the latest polls and the resulting predictions. FiveThirtyEight.com is maintained by Nate Silver who makes his living as a baseball statistician. Electoral-vote.com is maintained by Andrew Tanenbaum, a Computer Science professor and <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/appa.html">frequent thorn in Linus Torvalds' side</a>. I have added a graphic at the top-right of this blog that has the latest predictions from Electoral-vote.com. All of the above sites also have blogs that are updated at least daily with election news/opinions.</p>
<p>Below is an interview of Nate Silver on The Colbert Report where Nate explains some of the different graphs and statistics on his site.  For more detailed information about his site, you can read the site's extensive <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/03/frequently-asked-questions-last-revised.html">FAQ</a>.</p>
