<p>Please consider writing your representatives in Congress to support the <a href="http://change-congress.org/about/#legislation">Fair Elections Now Act</a> (<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-752">S. 752</a> and <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1826">H.R. 1286</a>); a bill that will greatly limit the damage done by the recent Supreme Court decision overturning a century of election law. Change Congress makes it easy to <a href="http://action.change-congress.org/page/speakout/fena">email your representatives</a>. See the video below for one reason why this is important.</p>
