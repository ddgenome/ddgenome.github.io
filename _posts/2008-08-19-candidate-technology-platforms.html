<p>Sen. McCain has recently released his <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/cbcd3a48-4b0e-4864-8be1-d04561c132ea.htm">technology platform</a>.  Sen. Obama has had his <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/technology/">technology platform</a> available for while. Sadly, Sen. McCain's proposals seem to favor moneyed, entrenched interests by opposing common sense patent reform and net neutrality.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Lawrence Lessig has <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/08/me_on_mccain_on_technology.html">posted his response</a> to Sen. McCain's technology platform.</p>
