<p>It doesn't quite have the same ring as "We're #1", but it's not bad to be the third ranked research medical school in the country.  <a href="http://www.usnews.com/">U.S. News and World Report</a> has released its annual <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad">rankings of graduate schools</a> and <a href="http://medschool.wustl.edu/">Washington University School of Medicine</a> was ranked <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/mdr/search">third among all medical schools</a>.  For individual programs, Washington University Medical School programs in <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/occ/search">Occupational Therapy</a> tied for first, <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/pht/search">Physical Therapy</a> tied for second, and <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/aud/search">Audiology and Communication Sciences</a> ranked five.</p>
<p>My alma mater, <a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>, tied for 19th among <a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/eng/search">engineering</a> programs.</p>
<p>Of course, these rankings don't really amount to much, but they do generate interest and give the top brass something to brag about.</p>
