<p>Well, the US is not the only place with interesting politics. I recently came across this <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/101stGMAppliedBiosystems.pdf">letter from Kevin McKernan, Senior Director of Scientific Operations at Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies, to the House of Lords in the UK (pdf)</a>. In the letter, McKernan expresses his concern that the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Sanger Institute</a>'s decision to <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/sanger-institute-returns-five-solids-life-technologies">return their SOLiD instruments</a> was due to some long-standing resentment of Applied Biosystems due to their association with Craig Venter and his challenge to the <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10001772">Human Genome Project</a>. Obviously there could be no valid scientific reason for their actions. And clearly the House of Lords is in the best position to establish that fact and rectify the situation. Sure, the Sanger Institute receives its funding from the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a>, an <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/index.htm">independent charity</a>, but even if the House of Lords can't pull their funding, they can always push an antitrust investigation, right?</p>
