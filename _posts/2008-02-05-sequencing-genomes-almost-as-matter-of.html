<p>Here is an <a href="http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/archives/august2007/genomes.html">article on genome sequencing</a>, specifically using next-generation sequencers, for which I was interviewed.  The article appeared in <a href="http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/">St. Louis Commerce Magazine</a> so it is a bit of a fluff piece; but another way to look at it is that it is a gentle introduction.</p>
<p>Here is another, more detailed article I was interviewed for in <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/">Bio-IT World</a> titled <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/issues/2007/july-aug/cover-story/">SNPing Away at Genome-Wide Disease Association Studies</a>.  It is a good overview of whole-genome array studies and how they will soon give way to whole genome sequencing using next-generation sequencers.</p>
