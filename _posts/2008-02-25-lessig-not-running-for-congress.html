<p>As <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/2008/02/lessig-for-congress.html">previously reported</a>, Lawrence Lessig was considering a run for Congress.  Turns out he <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html">decided not to run</a>, having decided it would not help his <a href="http://change-congress.org/">Change Congress</a> movement.  Below is a video with his full explanation.<br />
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="255" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="id" value="showplayer" /><param name="quality" value="best" /><param name="src" value="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Flessig%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash&amp;file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F699951&amp;brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2F%3Futm%5Fsource%3Dbrandlink&amp;brandname=blip%2Etv&amp;showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf" /><embed id="showplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="255" src="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Flessig%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash&amp;file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F699951&amp;brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2F%3Futm%5Fsource%3Dbrandlink&amp;brandname=blip%2Etv&amp;showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf" quality="best"></embed></object><br />
In short, there is no way that he could have won and feared that his loss would be viewed as a loss for the Change Congress movement.</p>
