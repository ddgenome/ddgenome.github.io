<p>As <a href="http://www.politigenomics.com/2008/02/lessig-for-congress.html">previously reported</a>, Lawrence Lessig was considering a run for Congress.  Turns out he <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html">decided not to run</a>, having decided it would not help his <a href="http://change-congress.org/">Change Congress</a> movement.  Below is a video with his full explanation.<br />

In short, there is no way that he could have won and feared that his loss would be viewed as a loss for the Change Congress movement.</p>
