<p>I watched the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22656153/">Democratic debate in Las Vegas</a> this evening.  It was a good debate after they got down to real issues and policy matters.  I think all the candidates did well, each had their good moments, and each had times they stumbled a bit.  I was pleasantly surprised that when asked what their weakest point was, Barack Obama actually gave a real answer, i.e., not the standard "I guess I care too much about baby sea lions".  So imagine my surprise when I watched the post-debate coverage on MSNBC and Chris Matthews essentially inaugurated Hillary Clinton.  Did she have a good debate?  She certainly did, but so did Barack Obama and John Edwards.  Some other pundits had more reasoned approaches, but a lot of the coverage I saw seemed to slant in that direction.  Why?  I wonder how the media will pick up on that in the reporting tomorrow.</p>
<p>I was also disappointed that Dennis Kucinich was not allowed to participate in the debate.  Regardless of what you think about him and his politics, a democracy is enriched by lively debate and he brings a different perspective than the other candidates.</p>
