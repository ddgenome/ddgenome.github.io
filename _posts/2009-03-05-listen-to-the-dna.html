<p>Well, it may not be as catchy a song title as "Listen to the Flower People", but the folks at <a href="http://www.dna-rainbow.org/">DNA rainbow</a>, after having gone to the effort of <a href="http://www.dna-rainbow.org/chromosomes/1.html">converting the human genome reference sequence into art</a>, have now converted it into audio. You can <a href="http://www.dna-rainbow.org/dna-radio.html">listen to a the entire human genome reference sequence, base by base</a>, if you have 23 years to kill. Don't worry, they haven't gotten to the good part yet, as they are still in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere">telomeric</a> region of chromosome 1. But hurry, you don't want to miss the plot twist in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6945/full/nature01782.html">chromosome 7</a>!</p>
