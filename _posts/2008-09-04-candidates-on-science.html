<p><a href="http://sharp.sefora.org/">Scientists and Engineers for America</a> have posted <a href="http://sharp.sefora.org/people/presidential-candidates/barack-obama-presidential-candidate/">Sen. Obama's responses to questions they sent him regarding his stance on a variety of science-related issues</a>. Sen. McCain has not responded, but SEA has an <a href="http://sharp.sefora.org/people/presidential-candidates/john-mccain-presidential-candidate/">analysis of his positions</a>. There is also a <a href="http://sharp.sefora.org/innovation2008/mccain-obama/">chart comparing the two candidates' positions on scientific issues</a>. Below is a summary of the candidates' major differences on these issues.

<li>Sen. McCain is a stronger supporter of nuclear energy than Sen. Obama (although both include it as part of their energy plan)</li>
<li>Sen. McCain supports expanding offshore drilling while Sen. Obama only would allow its expansion as part of a compromise plan that includes incentives for energy alternatives</li>
