As the COVID-19 global pandemic wears on, there is a lot of confusion
about whether one should wear a mask and what type of mask one should
wear.  The science is clear, unfortunately the communication has not
been.  For example, the [WHO recently updated its guidance on wearing
masks][who], maintaining the stance that everyone should wear masks,
but saying that healthy people need only wear _medical-grade_ masks,
e.g., N95 masks, when working with someone in a vulnerable population,
e.g., the elderly, diabetics, or people with compromised immune
systems, and should wear non-medical masks when physical distancing
cannot be guaranteed.  Fox News [failed to read the whole
document][fox] and concludes healthy people do not need to wear any
kind of mask.  Before you are too harsh on Fox, the initial Washington
Post article on the subject, which seems to no longer be available,
was not much clearer.  Their [newer article][wapo], courtesy of
Bloomberg News, is more clear.

To be fair, guidance on wearing masks has been evolving.  But to be
fair to those issuing the guidance, the early guidance was tempered by
the massive shortage of available medical-grade masks.  Not wanting to
worsen mask shortages, the WHO and CDC did not suggest healthy people
wear masks so the public would not start a run on masks, worsening the
shortage for medical workers, who needed them desperately in the early
days of the pandemic.  When production of medical-grade masks began to
catch up with demand, the CDC made these things clear:

-   Everyone should wear cloth masks when out in public and physical
    distancing cannot be guaranteed.  So if you are going to a store
    or gas station or picking up takeout, **wear a cloth mask**.  If
    you are taking a walk in your not-very-crowded neighborhood, you
    do not need to wear a mask as long as you maintain physical
    distancing from anyone else out and about.

-   If you have been exposed to COVID-19, you should isolate and wear
    a medical mask.

-   When around someone who has COVID-19, wear a medical mask.

Of late there is a lot of talk about how people who wear masks are
scared or not tough/strong/cool.  Since wearing a cloth mask is about
protecting the _people around you_, not yourself, it seems an odd, or
at least ill-informed conclusion.
