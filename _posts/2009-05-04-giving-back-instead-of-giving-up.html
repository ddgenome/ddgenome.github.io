<p>Here is a nice piece about some <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Story?id=7049080&page=1">furloughed auto workers in St. Louis giving back to the community</a> by volunteering their time at local charities, including the <a href="http://www.crisisnurserykids.com/">St. Louis Crisis Nursery</a>. Here's hoping these folks are not among the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30431844/">21,000 that will lose their jobs</a> by next year.</p>
