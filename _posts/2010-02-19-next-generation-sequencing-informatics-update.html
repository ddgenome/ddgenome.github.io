<p>I updated the <a href="/next-generation-sequencing-informatics">Next-Generation Sequencing Informatics table</a> a few weeks ago but forgot to mention it on the blog. The main update was the 50G configuration of the <a href="http://www.illumina.com/systems/genome_analyzer_iix.ilmn">Illumina GA IIx</a>. Also, the Sides & Associates blog linked to my table and referred to it as a "<a href="http://sidesandassociates.com/blog/2010/01/01/the-business-of-sequencing/">somewhat dated comparison of next-generation sequencing platforms</a>." Just to clarify, this table represents <em>average</em> throughput for <em>production</em> systems; not vendor claims about throughput, not future vaporware (and Alejandro Gutierrez corrected his description in the post once I pointed this out). As new systems come online and further improvements are made to existing platforms, the table will be updated.</p>
