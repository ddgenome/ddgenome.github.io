There are a few upcoming opportunities for people in the St. Louis area to help the Crisis Nursery out. On January 29th, <a href="http://www.keystoneofstlouis.org/">KeyStone of St. Louis</a> is hosting an event benefiting the Crisis Nursery at <a href="http://www.felixsrestaurant.com/">Felix's in Dogtown</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22486047@N03/3220331459/" title="KeystoneInviteJAN091 by ddgenome, on Flickr"><img src="/assets/3220331459_d68b24480d.jpg" width="458" height="361" alt="KeystoneInviteJAN091" /></a> It's only $20 for drinks and pizza!</p>
<p>A couple days later on January 31st, the <a href="http://www.stlautos.com/">St. Louis Auto Dealers Association</a> is hosting a <a href="http://www.saintlouisautoshow.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=89">Cheers for Children Charity Gala</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.saintlouisautoshow.com/">St. Louis Auto Show</a>. The St. Louis Crisis Nursery is one of the children's charities that will benefit from the event. <a href="http://www.saintlouisautoshow.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=89"><img src="/assets/SLADA_CharityGala_Invite-1.jpg" width="450" height="377" alt="St. Louis Auto Dealers Association Gala" /></a> Event tickets are $75 (VIP for $100) and include valet parking, hors d'oeuvres, drinks, live music, and after hours access to the auto show. So have some fun and make a difference in the life of a child.</p>
