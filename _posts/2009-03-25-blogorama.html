<p>For you RSS readers that do not visit the site, I thought I would point out a few of the blogs I have recently added to the Blogroll list on the right-hand side of the page. First, there are the infamous <a href="http://www.massgenomics.org/2009/02/genomics-bloggers-meet-at-agbt.html">AGBT genomics bloggers</a>, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/">Genetic Future's Daniel MacArthur</a> (the most prolific of the bunch), <a href="http://www.massgenomics.org/">Mass Genomics' Dan Koboldt</a>, and <a href="http://www.fejes.ca/">Anthony Fejes</a>. Others blogging in the genomics field are the imitable <a href="http://cryptogenomicon.org/">Sean Eddy</a> and <a href="http://genome.fieldofscience.com/">Steven Salzberg</a>, who recently moved his blog to <a href="http://www.fieldofscience.com/">Field of Science</a>. Finally, there are several more bloggers at <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Genome Center</a>, <a href="http://indraniel.livejournal.com/">Indraniel Das</a> from our LIMS group and Gary Stiehr, who has blogs on <a href="http://hpcinfo.wordpress.com/">high-performance computing</a> and <a href="http://researchitblog.wordpress.com/">research IT.</a></p>
