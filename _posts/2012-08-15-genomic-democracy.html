<p>With the advent of cheaper sequencing technologies over the last year or so, namely the continuing reductions in reagents costs and the precipitous drops in instrument costs, we have heard a lot about the "democratization of sequencing". That is, since sequencing is getting so much cheaper, everyone will start doing it.</p>
